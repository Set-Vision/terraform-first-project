# Terraform First Project

This is my first Terraform project, which includes:

- Creating an IAM user named `devops`
- Creating an S3 bucket with force_destroy enabled
- Using Terraform CLI to initialize, plan, apply, and destroy infrastructure
- GitHub version control without uploading the `.terraform` folder

## COMMANDS USED

```bash
terraform init  
terraform fmt  
terraform validate  
terraform plan  
terraform apply  
terraform destroy  

## REGION
